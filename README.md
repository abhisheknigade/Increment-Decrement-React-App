This React application is a straightforward yet visually appealing counter app that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a numerical value. The main interface consists of three primary buttons: a decrement button (-), an increment button (+), and a reset button. The current count is displayed prominently between the increment and decrement buttons, with a vertical line separator enhancing the visual clarity and separation of elements. A stylish background image spans the entire viewport, providing an engaging backdrop for the application. The app is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring that it looks and functions well on various devices and screen sizes. By leveraging React's useState hook for state management and incorporating modern styling techniques, this app combines functionality with a sleek and intuitive user interface.
